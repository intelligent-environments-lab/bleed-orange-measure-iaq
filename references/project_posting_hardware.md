# Hardware Manager for UT Campus Air Quality Monitoring Project

## Project Description

We plan to develop and deploy a sensor network on the university campus to provide continuously-measured indoor air quality (IAQ) monitoring of a few key pollutants: carbon dioxide, particulate matter of various sizes, total volatile organic compounds, and radon. We propose to use 10 sets of two, commercially-available devices to monitor these pollutants in addition to temperature and humidity. Two sets of devices will be placed in building spaces across the University of Texas at Austin that have similar use types: (1) small-capacity (<50 occupants) classrooms, (2) large-capacity (>300 occupants) classrooms, (3) on-campus cafeterias, (4) student common areas, and (5) building entrance lobbies. Measurements from these spaces will help identify typical concentrations of air pollutants that students are exposed to on a daily basis. In addition, facility and building managers can use these measurements to help make informed decisions regarding retrofits and other building improvements.
