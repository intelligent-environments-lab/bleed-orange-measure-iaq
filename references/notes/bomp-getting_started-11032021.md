# Background Reserach on Pollutants Measured in our Project

2. [Total VOCs](https://www.epa.gov/indoor-air-quality-iaq/what-are-volatile-organic-compounds-vocs)
3. [CO2 Indoors](https://www.indoorairhygiene.org/co2-explained/)
4. [Radon](https://www.epa.gov/radon)

The linked articles are just to get you started, but feel free to gather any other basic knowledge about these indoor air quality (IAQ) parameters. Make sure for the first three that you are learning about them in the context of the *indoor* environment and not ambient.

# Familiarize Yourself with Github

I don't think that we will be using Github extensively at least for this semester, but I still want you both to be comfortable working with it. The repository for this project is [here](https://github.com/intelligent-environments-lab/bleed-orange-measure-iaq). We will be using it primarily for storing important files and you can use it submit issues if anything problematic pops up. 

There are countless documents and videos out there but I learned from [this guy](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BCQHnlnPusY&t=1s).

# Learn How to Connect Purple Air Devices

On Friday, we are going to spend time getting our Purple Air (PA) devices hooked up to the internet and registered. Spend some time on [this page](https://www2.purpleair.com/pages/install) to learn how to hook them up although we will have to do an extra step to connect them to the utexas-iot network. 

# Poke Around the AirThings for Business Site

Unlike the PAs, I have never used AirThings devices before so you two will be in charge of taking the deep dive into installing and using them. You should both be able to access the [admin account](https://dashboard.airthings.com).

# [Optional] Learn Some Basic Python

If you have the time and want to fill out your hours, look into polishing up your Python skills. We won't need these skills too much right now, but we will in the near future. Just like with Github, there are a ton of resources out there. For right now, I would try looking for courses that have you programming through their interface but if you want your own IDE to mess around in I would recommend working through Jupyter Notebooks or through Spyder both of which come when you install [Anaconda](https://www.anaconda.com/products/individual).
