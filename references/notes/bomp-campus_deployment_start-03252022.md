# Starting Campus Deployment
Steps and initial deployment of devices across campus (!!)

## Updates

### Dashboard Help
We are working with facilities to see if we can incorporate the data we collect to the [UT building map](https://utdirect.utexas.edu/apps/campus/buildings/nlogon/facilities/). Doing so would allow us to display our data and use the backend that facilities already has in place. 

Regardless if we tie in our data with facilities, we will likely get help from an undegraduate CS student to develop the dashboard.

### Data Analysis Updates
Any updates from Angelina and/or Kyle?

## Starting Campus Deployment

### Device Recovery
We need to grab the following devices:

**Third Floor**
* Classroom 1
* Classroom 2
* Classroom 3
* Computer Lab

**Fifth Floor**
* Atila's Office
* CEPM Office 1
* CEPM Office 2

### Building Remaining Beacons
I think we still need one or two more RPis set up to connect to the AirThings devices. 

### Debugging Beacons
Once we have all the devices back, we will need to check them one-by-one to see which are having issues, what the issues are, and what are the solutions. 

### Sensor Box Setup
Assuming all things work, we need to create our sensor box:
1. Setup metal cages
  * remove excess accessories
  * Cut hole for power cables
2. Gather all necessary materials
  * 10 AirThings (check batteries)
  * 10 PurpleAirs
  * 10 RPi Beacons and 10 power cables
4. Develop and place research label on the metal cages indicating that these sensors are a part of a Green Fund Initiative.
5. Update the Wiki page so we can include it on the label which will act as an information page.
  * Might want to also include a link/blurb about the storefront capabilities
6. Configure devices in the metal cage. We should think of ways to securely fasten the devices to the cage so they don't rattle about during deployment or if they are moved. 

### Deployment
Once we have everything in order, we can begin the deployment process! Below is the updated locations for deployment:

## Next Steps

* Building remaining beacons (Angelina/Kyle)
* Debug beacons (Hagen/Angelina/Kyle)
* Setup metal cages (Angelina/Kyle)
* Gather necessary materials (Hagen)
* Research label (Angelina/Kyle)
* Update Wiki page (Hagen)
* Configure devices in metal cage (Angelina/Kyle)
* Begin deployment (Hagen/Angelina/Kyle)
