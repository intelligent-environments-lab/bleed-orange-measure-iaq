# ECJ Beta Test Data Review
Looking at the data that was measured during the 4-week beta test in ECJ

## Updates from Hagen

### Device Recovery
Removing the devices later today from:
* Dr. Leite's Office
* Dr. Faust's Office

I cannot get the devices from the CEPM offices until after Spring Break. So are plan will be to pick-up all devices the week after Spring Break from both floors.

### Device Deployment
I will speak with Zoltan about placing the devices around campus and what steps we need to take.

## Updates from Angelina
Created a script that plots and provides summary statistics for each space based on the AirThings serial number.
* Data look reasonable although perhaps slightly lower than anticipated; values drop to just above 400 ppm. Perhaps the ventilation in ECJ is good enough to remove all that CO2?
* Timestamp formatting issues which makes understanding the data challenging

## Updates from Kyle 
Data summary from PurpleAir devices

## Next Steps

### Immediate
* Recover devices from ECJ (Hagen)
* Determine steps for deployment (Hagen)
* Debug issues with AirThings connectivity (all)
