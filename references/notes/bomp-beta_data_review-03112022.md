### Device Recovery
Removing the devices later today from:
* Dr. Leite's Office
* Dr. Faust's Office

I cannot get the devices from the CEPM offices until after Spring Break. So are plan will be to pick-up all devices the week after Spring Break from both floors.

### Device Deployment
I will speak with Zoltan about placing the devices around campus and what steps we need to take.
