# Beta Setup

Now that you all are getting up to speed with the background research and some of the software in addition to setting up a few of the sensors, we can start ramping up for a beta (or what might be the actual setup) test. 

## AirThings HUB Testing - Angelina and Kyle

Since you both have a HUB and a Wave, I figured you could both do some testing if you like. We want to check a few parameters in the most _realistic_ conditions i.e. in campus buildings:

* Number of floors in between HUB and sensor?
* Number of "normal" walls between HUB and sensor?
* Construction types that signficantly hamper HUB/sensor communiation? Such as cinder blocks, elevators/metal doors, etc. 

If possible, I would try doing these tests in ECJ and you both might even consider working together _at the same time_ on this so that someone can watch the Hub while another runs around ECJ. 

## AirThings Beta Testing Locations - Angelina

There are a few _private_ locations that we can aim for while we get the housing sorted out:

* IELab - ECJ B.102

* Zoltan's Office - ECJ 5.436

* Atila's Office - ECJ 5.430

* 5th Floor BEE Offices - ECJ 5.441

* Kerry's Office - ECJ 9.102

  _or_ CAEE Main Office - ECJ 4.200 (depending on if we can reach the 9th floor)

* 5th Floor CEPM Offices - 5.418 _(waiting on confirmation)_

I was thinking we set up a Hub in the basement for the lab and then one in Zoltan's office for the remaining sensors. When you register the devices, target the _first 4_ locations. Add in Kerry's office if you can reach the 9th floor from the Hub on the 5th floor. Otherwise, we can ask to put it in the main office on the 4th floor. 

In case you are curious, you can get the layout of ECJ [here](https://utdirect.utexas.edu/apps/campus/buildings/nlogon/facilities/UTM/ECJ/). 

## Sensor Housing - Kyle

Zoltan suggested scrapping the idea of making our own housing for various _good_ reasons that I won't elaborate on here. Instead, he suggested we just use a metal wire mesh cage like [this one](https://sc01.alicdn.com/kf/HTB14y6QFpGWBuNjy0Fbq6z4sXXa6/222196057/HTB14y6QFpGWBuNjy0Fbq6z4sXXa6.jpg). 

Please take some time to find a mesh cage like that that:

* fits both devices
* is portable i.e. not too heavy
* allows for air to easily flow in-and-out but doesn't let people reach inside
* has a way to lock 

If the cage does not come with one, please find some suitable locks that we can use. When you are done, send the links over (preferrably from **Amazon**) to me so that we can order them.

## Sensor Beta Setup - Angelina, Hagen, and Kyle

Since we are targeting private locations, we can spend next meeting going around to those spots and setting everything up regardless if the housing arrives on time. 

## [Optional] Python, Git, and AirThings API

If you have extra time, feel free to continue learning Python, Git/Github, and/or look into the [Airthings API](https://developer.airthings.com/docs/api-getting-started/index.html).
