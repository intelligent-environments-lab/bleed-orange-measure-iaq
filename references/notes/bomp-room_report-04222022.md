# Participant/Room Report
A look at some of the data from our Beta test in ECJ. 



# Follow-Up

### Deployment
1. What was the device ID we placed in ECJ?

Might be nice to formalize an ID for our kits which might need to be a combination of the AirThings + PurpleAir MACs.

2. Deploying another kit in EER later today.
