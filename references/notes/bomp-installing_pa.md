# Installing/Registering Purple Air Devices

The installation instructions provided by Purple Air can be found [here](https://www2.purpleair.com/pages/install). This document highlights the unique aspects of installing these devices for the Bleed Orange, Measure Purple Project.

## Register Device to utexas-iot Network

1.  Go to network.utexas.edu

2. Login using the IEL account:

   Username: n2964

   Password: z***9

3. Click the button to "Register Wireless Device"

4. Enter the MAC Address

   The length of the MAC address should be 12 digits long with 2 digits between each colon. If a digit is missing, that means there is a leading zero that has been omitted. For example, in the MAC address `A9:BB:58:B:09:43`, `:B:` is really `:0B`. 

5. Name the device `PA_####` using the last four digits of the device's MAC address in place of the `####`.

## Install Purple Air

Now follow the instructions to [install the Purple Air](https://www2.purpleair.com/pages/install) provided by the company. Once you have successfully connected to the device:

1. Choose `utexas-iot` as the WiFi network
2. Copy the password from network.utexas.edu and **remove all spaces** _including_ the leading space that sometimes get copied over.
