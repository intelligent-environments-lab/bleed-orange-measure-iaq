# Bleed Orange, Measure Purple Storefront
As we near the final weeks of the project, we need to develop a process for the storefront that UT affiliates can check out devices from.

## Other Updates

### Initial Deployment in ECJ and EER
Check on devices to see if they are still running and collecting data.

The rechargeable batteries I purchased do not fit into the devices so we will need to purchase another set. From what a colleague mentioned to me, rechargeable batteries didn't work well for her, but I still think that is the way we should go. We just now have to be careful that:
1. the batteries aren't too big
2. we can use the charger I also bought from Amazon to charge the batteries

Assuming everything else is okay with our kits, I will email out to building managers to see about deploying more. I think there are still issues with some of the kits, but we can debug those as we go. 

### ECJ Beta Participant Reports
Updates on the data analysis and visuals for the 3 professors who allowed us to place devices in their office.

I created a folder on Google Drive that everyone can access to store raw data, stats/analysis, and visuals. If you think there should be additional folders (perhaps processed_data?), feel free to add any. My hope is that I can compile the information and figures that you all created and send out the report by the end of next week.
