# Bleed Orange, Measure Purple Storefront
As we near the final weeks of the project, we need to develop a process for the storefront that UT affiliates can check out devices from.

### Devices
We need to decide which devices we wish to have available for checkout. We have plenty of PurpleAir sensors (both indoor and outdoor) that we could include in addition to a few of the BEVO Beacons. Unfortunately we don't have any AirThings devices but perhaps we could order a few more and use those. We have two hubs which we don't plan on using so perhaps two more AirThings?

### Check-out Process
We will need to brainstorm the process through which people will pick up devices. I am thinking some sort of Qualtrics/Google Form that can be accessed through a variety of places:
* on Zoltan's website
* on the GitHub page
* QR code scannable at the lab

From there, we can meet with the person, get a sense of their project, and rent out the devices. 

### Scope
In order for things to run smoothly, I think we need to limit the scope of projects that can be conducted. For now, I think we have to enforce two restrictions:
* experiments _must_ be conducted where the utexas IoT network is available
* experiments _must_ be limited to two (?) weeks

There might be other conditions as well that we should consider. 

### Damage, Lost, or Stolen
Dealing with devices that are damaged, lost, or stolen is going to be tricky. I don't know the best method to go about this or if there is any punishment we can enforce or collateral we can take. Since they are UT affiliates, we can get EIDs but not sure if we would be able to take action on anyone. 

## Other Updates

### Initial Deployment in ECJ and EER
Check on devices to see if they are still running and collecting data.

The rechargeable batteries I purchased do not fit into the devices so we will need to purchase another set. From what a colleague mentioned to me, rechargeable batteries didn't work well for her, but I still think that is the way we should go. We just now have to be careful that:
1. the batteries aren't too big
2. we can use the charger I also bought from Amazon to charge the batteries

Assuming everything else is okay with our kits, I will email out to building managers to see about deploying more. I think there are still issues with some of the kits, but we can debug those as we go. 

### ECJ Beta Participant Reports
Updates on the data analysis and visuals for the 3 professors who allowed us to place devices in their office.

I created a folder on Google Drive that everyone can access to store raw data, stats/analysis, and visuals. If you think there should be additional folders (perhaps processed_data?), feel free to add any. My hope is that I can compile the information and figures that you all created and send out the report by the end of next week. 

## Next Steps
1. Finalize storefront setup
2. Begin storefront setup
3. Start to rollout more sensor kits
4. Finalize and compile results from ECJ beta test
