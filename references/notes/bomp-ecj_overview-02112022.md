# ECJ Experiment Overview
Today we focus on the current, initial status of the beta test going on in ECJ. 

## Device Setup Status
Currently, we have 8/10 device pairs set up:

| Room Number | Room Description |       Setup        |
| ----------- | ---------------- | :----------------: |
| 3.106       | Computer Room    | :white_check_mark: |
| 3.110       | Small Classroom  |  |
| 3.116       | Large Classroom  | :white_check_mark: |
| 3.406       | Medium Classroom | :white_check_mark: |
| 3.232       | Office Spaces    |  |
| 5.430       | larger, single office | :white_check_mark: |
| 5.438       | normal, single office | :white_check_mark: |
| 5.302       | normal, single office | :white_check_mark: |
| 5.404       | shared office (CEPM)  | :white_check_mark: |
| 5.412       | shared office (CEPM)  | :white_check_mark: |

ECJ 3.110 was occupied on 02/09 when I had been setting up, below is the schedule:

ECJ 3.232 is where IT is located and the door was locked and no one responded to my knocking. I need to email back about scheduling an actual appointment. 

## AirThings Status
All devices are connected! Carbon dioxide concentratiosn seem to be fluctuating as expected based on occupancy changes. 

## Purple Air Status
All devices are connected! Seems that we have included a PA outside of the original 10 that we had from previous research efforts in the basement somewhere (near the coffee maker I suspect). 

# Next Steps

## Immediate
* Continue to monitor PA and AirThings devices and make a plan to ensure all devices are reporting data
* Submit status report to Office of Sustainability
* Install the last two pairs of monitors
* Create "research in progress" labels
* Create RPi beacons for AirThings devices
  * [Find a time to meet](https://www.when2meet.com/?14560449-XKDE5)
  * Review the [Github Repo](https://github.com/kogant/waveplus-reader)
  * Gather necessary materials
  * Build and test (targeting AirThings devices that don't connect to Hub)
* Send Github username to Hagen so you can be added to IEL group

## Secondary
* Read up on AWS S3 storage and Athena
* Formalized storefront
